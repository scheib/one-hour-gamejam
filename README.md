Almost finished the transform code to have a rotating mirror of an image. Game play was going to be: 

- Player shown an image with a single mirror cut on it (random rotation and position). 
- Player then given control of the mirror and reproduce the same image as fast as possible.

Basic rendering of some clouds over a sky with a glow. The clipping for the glow didn't work, but is intended to have a clipped out shadow from each cloud. Gameplay (not even started) would be to move left right at bottom and minimize (or maximize) exposure to sun.
