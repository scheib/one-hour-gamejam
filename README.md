2013-01-31 Flower
-----------------

**Completed something playable.**

http://scheib.github.com/one-hour-gamejam/flower/flower.html

Find matching flowers in a field.

2013-01-24 Economy
------------------

Incomplete.

http://scheib.github.com/one-hour-gamejam/economy/economy.html

Barely got UI up to change initial state. Was going to implement some simple 'tax the rich or the poor more, decide how much to spend' game that simulated the results.


2013-01-17 Second Chance
------------------------

Incomplete, but something happens.

http://scheib.github.com/one-hour-gamejam/second-chance/second-chance.html

"I don't believe in the sun".  The game is a play off the Magnetic Fields song I Don't Believe In The Sun. You move to stay in the sun as much as possilbe until you believe in it again.

This game extended 2013-01-03 Clouds.

2013-01-10 Traffic
------------------

**Completed something playable.**

http://scheib.github.com/one-hour-gamejam/traffic/traffic.html

Control the flow of traffic crossing an intersection. Avoid collisions.

Also, a [more complete version](http://scheib.github.com/one-hour-gamejam/traffic/traffic2.html) finished after the 1 hour.


2013-01-03 Clouds
-----------------

Incomplete.

http://scheib.github.com/one-hour-gamejam/clouds/clouds.html

Basic rendering of some clouds over a sky with a glow. The clipping for the glow didn't work, but is intended to have a clipped out shadow from each cloud. Gameplay (not even started) would be to move left right at bottom and minimize (or maximize) exposure to sun.

2012-12-06 Mirror
-----------------

Incomplete.

http://scheib.github.com/one-hour-gamejam/mirror/mirror.html

Almost finished the transform code to have a rotating mirror of an image. Game play was going to be: 

- Player shown an image with a single mirror cut on it (random rotation and position). 
- Player then given control of the mirror and reproduce the same image as fast as possible.
